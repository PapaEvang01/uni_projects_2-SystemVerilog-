🟦 VGA Tic-Tac-Toe Game (SystemVerilog – Nexys A7)

This project implements a fully playable two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game using VGA output on an FPGA board 
(tested on the Nexys A7-100T with a 100 MHz clock). 

The game uses VGA display to render a 3x3 grid, move a cursor, and draw 'X' and 'O' symbols using ROM-based graphics.

🎮 Gameplay Features:
- Two-player game using 5 buttons: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, and PLAY
- Cursor highlights the current selectable square
- Alternating turns between players (Player X starts)
- Win/tie detection logic for rows, columns, and diagonals
- Real-time symbol rendering from ROM memory

🖥️ VGA Display:
- Resolution: 800x600 @ 72Hz
- Pixel timing logic handles HSYNC and VSYNC
- Symbols displayed using pixel ROMs (X_ROM and O_ROM)
- Squares are separated with white lines
- Cursor is shown as a small blinking rectangle

📂 Files:
- `top.sv` – Top-level module: game logic, VGA timing, rendering
- `edge_detector.sv` – Edge detector for button debouncing
- `X_ROM.sv` – Pixel ROM for 'X' symbol
- `O_ROM.sv` – Pixel ROM for 'O' symbol
- `fpga_pins.xdc` – FPGA constraints file (buttons, VGA, clock, etc.)

🔧 How to Use:
1. Connect buttons to the FPGA as defined in `fpga_pins.xdc`
2. Attach a VGA monitor
3. Compile and upload the design
4. Use buttons to navigate and play

This was one of my first complete VGA-based games in hardware – a fun way to combine digital design, graphics, and game logic all in one!
