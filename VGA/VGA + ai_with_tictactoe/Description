🕹️ VGA Tic-Tac-Toe with AI – SystemVerilog FPGA Project

📌 This project is an enhanced version of the previous simple VGA-based Tic-Tac-Toe game.
It now features an automatic player (AI) for 'O', allowing single-player gameplay against the FPGA.

This project implements a complete Tic-Tac-Toe game using SystemVerilog, designed for FPGA boards with VGA output and button inputs.
It features both human interaction and an automatic opponent using simple AI logic.

🔧 Core Features:
- Visual game board rendered on VGA (800x600 resolution at 72Hz)
- Cursor control using FPGA buttons (up/down/left/right/play)
- ROM-based rendering for 'X' and 'O' symbols
- Real-time win/tie detection and game over handling
- AI player (for 'O') with priority logic:
   1. Win if possible
   2. Block if needed
   3. Choose the first available move

📁 Included Files:
- top.sv ................. Top-level game logic (main module)
- edge_detector.sv ....... Detects rising edges from mechanical buttons
- MoveGen.sv ............. AI logic to select the next move
- X_ROM.sv ............... VGA pattern for displaying 'X'
- O_ROM.sv ............... VGA pattern for displaying 'O'
- fpga_pins.xdc .......... FPGA constraints for button, clock, and VGA pin mapping

🎯 Notes:
- Designed and tested for Nexys A7 FPGA board.
- AI logic and game behavior implemented entirely in SystemVerilog.
- Button edge detection is used to avoid signal bouncing.

This project is ideal for demonstrating digital system design, FSM control, VGA timing, and basic AI decision-making on FPGAs.
